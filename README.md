Node Ubold - Vertical
=======================

A seed project in node, express, mongo, etc. This project is bootstraped using [hackathon-starter](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter). You might want to review the details there.

Prerequisite
---------------
* Make sure to have installed and running `node` (v10.x) on your system
* Make sure to have installed and running `mongo` on your system


Getting Started
---------------

```bash
# Open up terminal

# Change directory
cd myproject

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Then simply start your app
node app.js
```


**Note:** You might want to use [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).
It watches for any changes in your  node.js app and automatically restarts the
server. Once installed, instead of `node app.js` use `nodemon app.js`. It will
save you a lot of time in the long run, because you won't need to manually
restart the server each time you make a small change in code. To install, run
`sudo npm install -g nodemon`.
